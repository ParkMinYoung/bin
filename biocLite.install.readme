Troubleshoot BiocInstaller

If you see a message like this:
BiocInstaller version 3.2 is too old for R version 3.3
â€¦do the following:
1. Quit your R session
2. Start a new session with R --vanilla
3. Run the command remove.packages("BiocInstaller", lib=.libPaths())
4. Repeat that command until R says there is no such package.
5. Run the command source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
6. Run biocValid() to ensure your installed packages are valid for the current version of Bioconductor, and follow the instructions it gives you.
7. biocLite()                  ## R version 3.0 or later
